Project Specification Feedback
==================

Commit graded: 5cdf114619e552409a1f6d4c90bede8303deacd4

### The product backlog (10/10)
•	A spreadsheet-like format is easier to read for backlogs, rather than prose or bulleted lists.  You could also explore existing online tools for generating and tracking work on a project.
•	Next time provide a cost estimate for each feature, in hours.  If the cost estimate is more than 5 or 8 hours, consider breaking the feature into smaller work units to improve their ability to track progress on it. 
•	I agree that following is unnecessary focus on the core functionality of your application

### Data models (7/10)
•	We were expecting a more formal specification of the models, it didn’t have to be code however if not code should have been something like uml to more rigorously show the relationship between models. 
•	Unclear from model how you separate between different file types (homework, notes, etc.) based on models
•	Should make sure you understand the relationships between all your models whether they are many to many, one to one, etc. 

### Wireframes or mock-ups (9/10)
-Wireframes don’t show how to upload files/what the instructor’s view will be like and how to register for classes 
-Register page should differentiate between student and teacher
